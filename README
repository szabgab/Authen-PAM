DESCRIPTION
===========

This module provides a Perl interface to the PAM library.

Home site: <http://nik.pelov.name/Authen-PAM/>

After installing the module you can read a small faq with
examples by typing 'perldoc Authen::PAM::FAQ'.


PREREQUISITES
=============

Before you can build Authen::PAM you need to have the following
things installed on your system:

  * Perl, at least version 5.003_23
  * This module is known to work with the following or newer 
    implementations of the PAM library:
    - Linux-PAM  <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/>
    - Solaris 2.6
    - FreeBSD 3.1
    - OpenPAM <http://openpam.sourceforge.net/>
    - HP-UX 11.0
    - Darwin 6.0 and Mac OS X 10.2


BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE MODULE
==================================

Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, you can built the module 
using the standard sequence of commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

By default the module is build using the compiler and options used to build
the perl executable itself. If you want to change the C compiler then set
the CC environment variable, for example like this:

    CC=gcc perl Makefile.PL

However, besides changing the compiler, it is still not possible to change
any other options (for example CFLAGS). If you want to do this then you
should edit by hand the generated Makefile.

If you have any problems in building and installing the module then
you should first check on the home page of the Authen::PAM module for
the latest development version (if any) which could possibly fix your
problems. If none is available or the problems remain then you can
write me a mail which includes the following information:
  * the version of your unix - `uname -a'
  * the configuration of the perl - `perl -V'
  * if you are on linux:
    - the name and version of the distribution you are using
    - the version of the pam - `ls /lib/libpam.so*' or `ls /usr/lib/libpam.so*'
  * the description of the "login" service from your pam configuration -
    usually found in `/etc/pam.conf' file or in the file `/etc/pam.d/login'
  * the output of the `perl Makefile.PL', `make' and `make test'
  * any relevant messages produced by the syslogd daemon -
    usually found in `/var/log/messages'
  * if the problem is in a perl script which uses the Authen::PAM module then
    the source of this script (even if it is a slight modification of some
    of the source code provided with this module)


KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

  Missing PAM header files
  ------------------------

  I know that this is trivial, but some people actually report this.
  If you get an error like

	PAM.xs:11: security/pam_appl.h: No such file or directory

  this means that either you don't have the PAM library installed on
  your system or at least the PAM header files are missing. If your
  distribution provides the PAM library as packages then you should
  check that you also have installed the pam-dev or pam-devel package.


  FreeBSD 4.x
  -----------
  Several people have reported the following error during 'make test':
    not ok 10 (28 - Module is unknown)
  I've tracked down the problem to the dynamic loader of FreeBSD not
  exporting some symbols in dlopen()'d modules. I've submitted a bug 
  report - http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=25059
  It seems that this bug has been fixed already and starting
  from the next release of FreeBSD (probably 4.6) the module should
  work again.


  Solaris 2.8
  -----------
  Some users are reporting the following error during 'make test':
    Segmentation Fault - core dumped
    make: *** [test_dynamic] Error 139
  The problem seems to be related with the use of Kerberos
  authentication (pam_krb5 or pam_krb54). At this moment I don't have
  any explanation for it.


  Login Restrictions
  ------------------
  Most of the current configurations of the 'login' service include a
  module 'pam_securetty' or 'pam_access' which restrict the login of 
  some users (especially root) depending on the tty or the host name
  they are logging from. The configuration files of these two modules
  are /etc/securetty and  /etc/security/access.conf respectively.
  So, if you are running 'make test' and get an error 
  '(Authentication failure)' on test 10 then this might be due to
  login restrictions of PAM.


  Deprecated
  ----------

  The following problems occured on old versions of libraries and OSes
  and are not included in the README file anymore. If you experience them,
  check the README file in older versions of the PAM library (0.14 or less).
  - Solaris 2.6 buggy PAM library
  - Perl 5.004_03
  - RedHat 6.1 (Authentication failure)
  - RedHat 8.0 (Segmentation fault (core dumped))
